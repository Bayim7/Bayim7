## 👋 Hi, I'm Ibrahim | AI Student & Aspiring ML Engineer

I'm a first-year **Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence** student at **Johannes Kepler University (JKU), Linz**, on a deliberate path into the data field. I'm building a broad, practical skill set across **Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, and Data Analytics**, with the goal of discovering my specialization through hands-on projects and internships.

**My Core Idea:** Explore through building. Understand the fundamentals, then apply them to solve real problems.

### 🚀 Current Focus & Project

I'm currently in the planning phase of building my **flagship portfolio project**: a **Production-Grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System**.
Gathering and sharpening necessary skills and tools required for the project. 

*   **Goal:** To build an iterative, end-to-end system that progresses from a simple prototype to a fully containerized, deployable API.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Hugging Face `sentence-transformers`, SQLite, Git, MLflow, Docker.
*   **What it demonstrates:** Data pipelining, NLP, model serving, software engineering best practices, and MLOps principles.
*   **Repository:** coming soon!!!
This project embodies my builder's mindset and my focus on bridging theoretical knowledge with industry-ready implementation.
